Configure file backups from miniRUEDI computers to miniruedi.aquatic-research.ch server
=======================================================================================

Preliminary notes:
* These files are used to backup files from miniRUEDI computers to miniruedi.aquatic-research.ch.

* The files are managed at http://github.com/brennmat/backupdocs

* The whole backup approach is:
	(1) Primary backup: miniRUEDI computer(s) send their data file backups to miniruedi.aquatic-research.ch
	(2) Secondary backup: Eawag pulls in the files from miniruedi.aquatic-research.ch for archiving within the Eawag IT infrastructure


Setting up the primary backup:

1. Set up ssh access
--------------------

On client computer:

*** IMPORTANT: RUN THIS AS THE NORMAL USER (e.g., water or ruedi) IN THE HOME DIRECTORY OF THIS USER, NOT AS root! ***

Create ssh keys on client:
>> ssh-keygen -t ed25519
(the suggested defaults are fine, leave passphrase empty)

Copy contents of .ssh/id_ed25519.pub to .ssh/authorized_keys on backup server (will have to use a machine that is already configured to access the backup server)
on backup server:
>> nano .ssh/authorized_keys
--> add (copy/paste) the public key from the client

Set up .ssh/config
>> nano .ssh/config
enter the following config:
--------------------------
Host miniruedi
	User debian
	Hostname miniruedi.aquatic-research.ch
	IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
	IdentitiesOnly yes

Host *
	AddKeysToAgent yes
	ForwardAgent yes
--------------------------

Check if ssh access from client computer to backup server works:
(connecting the first time will ask to add key/fingerprint to known host, which should be "yes")
>> ssh miniruedi
--> this should connect to the backup server


2. Set up the backup
--------------------

Install rdiff-backup on client machine:
sudo apt install rdiff-backup

Copy backup script files / templates to client computer:
>> ssh miniruedi 'cat backupdocs_svn/backupscript.sh' > ~/.backupscript.sh && chmod +x .backupscript.sh 
>> ssh miniruedi 'cat backupdocs_svn/excludelist.txt' > ~/.excludelist.txt

Set up cron job on client machine (see also www.crontab.guru). For example, to run 1 minute after midnight and at rebboot (if machine was turned off):
>> crontab -e   <--- don't use sudo!
--------------------------------------
1 0 * * * /home/<user>/.backupscript.sh
@reboot /home/<user>/.backupscript.sh
--------------------------------------

where <user> = water, ruedi, etc.
