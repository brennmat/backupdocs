Configure file backups from miniRUEDI computers to miniruedi.aquatic-research.ch server
=======================================================================================


1. Set up ssh access
--------------------

On client computer:

IMPORTANT: RUN THIS AS THE NORMAL USER (e.g., water) IN THE HOME DIRECTORY OF THIS USER, NOT AS root!

create ssh keys on client:
>> ssh-keygen -t ed25519
(the suggested defaults are fine, leave passphrase empty)

copy contents of .ssh/id_ed25519.pub to .ssh/authorized_keys on backup server (will have to use a machine that is already configured to access the backup server)
on backup server:
nano .ssh/authorized_keys
--> add (copy/paste) the public key from the client

set up .ssh/config
>> nano .ssh/config
Enter the following config:
--------------------------
Host miniruedi
	User debian
	Hostname miniruedi.aquatic-research.ch
	IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
	IdentitiesOnly yes

Host *
	AddKeysToAgent yes
	ForwardAgent yes
--------------------------

check if ssh access from client computer to backup server works:
(connecting the first time will ask to add key/fingerprint to known host, which should be "yes")
>> ssh miniruedi
--> this should connect to the backup server


2. Set up the backup
--------------------

install rdiff-backup on client machine:
sudo apt install rdiff-backup

copy backup script files / templates to client computer:
>> scp miniruedi:backupdocs_svn/backupscript.sh ./
>> scp miniruedi:backupdocs_svn/excludelist.txt ./

rename the files so they are hidden (helps to avoid accidental removal or changes):
>> mv backupscript.sh .backupscript.sh
>> mv excludelist.txt .excludelist.txt

make sure the backup script is executable:
>> chmod +x .backupscript.sh 

adjust miniRUEDI name in destination path for backups in the .backupscript.sh file.
>> nano .backupscript.sh
--> change miniRUEDI name in destination path

TO DO!! set up anacron for daily execution of the backup script.

CRONTAB ENTRY WILL WORK IF COMPUTER IS DOWN AT THE RUNTIME OF THE BACKUP JOB:
set up cron job on client machine (see also www.crontab.guru).
For example:
>> crontab -e   <--- don't use sudo!
1 0 * * * /home/water/.backupscript.sh

make sure anacron is installed on client machine (so cronjob will be executed if/after the machine was off at the time specified for the backupsript in crontab).
